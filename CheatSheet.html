<h3>Word Wide Web General</h3>
<h4>1.What are the most essential technologies that made the World Wide Web such a success?</h4>
<h5> In 1988 the first direct IP connection between Europe and North America was made and Berners-Lee began to openly discuss the possibility of a web-like system at CERN.</h5>

<h4>2.How are resources (html pages, images, etc) addressed in the web?</h4>
<h5>Most web pages contain hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files, source documents, definitions and other web resources. In the underlying HTML, a hyperlink looks like this: <a href="http://www.example.org/home.html">Example.org Homepage</a></h5>

<h4>3.What are the general components of a url?</h4>
<h5>A URL for HTTP (or HTTPS) is normally made up of three or four components:
A scheme. 
The scheme identifies the protocol to be used to access the resource on the Internet. It can be HTTP (without SSL) or HTTPS (with SSL).
<br><br>
A host.<br> 
The host name identifies the host that holds the resource. For example, www.example.com. A server provides services in the name of the host, but hosts and servers do not have a one-to-one mapping. Refer to Host names.
Host names can also be followed by a port number. Refer to Port numbers. Well-known port numbers for a service are normally omitted from the URL. Most servers use the well-known port numbers for HTTP and HTTPS , so most HTTP URLs omit the port number.
<br><br>
A path.<br> 
The path identifies the specific resource in the host that the web client wants to access. For example, /software/htp/cics/index.html.
<br><br>
A query string.<br>  
If a query string is used, it follows the path component, and provides a string of information that the resource can use for some purpose (for example, as parameters for a search or as data to be processed). The query string is usually a string of name and value pairs; for example, term=bluebird. Name and value pairs are separated from each other by an ampersand (&); for example, term=bluebird&source=browser-search.</h5>

<h3>Web Server</h3>

<h4>1.What is a web server?</h4>
<h5>A Web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve the files that form Web pages to users, in response to their requests, which are forwarded by their computers' HTTP clients. Dedicated computers and appliances may be referred to as Web servers as well.</h5>

<h4>2.What are the most essential technologies that made the World Wide Web such a success?</h4>
<h5>The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.[4][5][6] Web pages are primarily text documents formatted and annotated with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).[7] In addition to formatted text, web pages may contain images, video, audio, and software components that are rendered in the user's web browser as coherent pages of multimedia content.</h5>

<h4>How can content be stored on a web server?</h4>
<h5>There is no centralized storage of data at any one place but it is stored in the hard disks of numerous web servers all over the world. Web server is also a computer, but it’s a jumbo-sized mainframe computer having different functions. It consists of a number of cupboard size racks known as data centers which are connected with one another as well as with the Internet.</h5>

<h4>How is content in webpages described?</h4>
<h5>Web content is the textual, visual, or aural content that is encountered as part of the user experience on websites. It may include—among other things—text, images, sounds, videos, and animations.</h5>

<h4>What is the html head element?</h4>
<h5>The HTML head Element. The head element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the html tag and the body tag. HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. ... Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, links, scripts, and other meta information.</h5>

<h4>What does <!DOCTYPE` html> mean?</h4>
<h5>The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the html tag. ... In HTML 4.01, the <!DOCTYPE> declaration refers to a DTD, because HTML 4.01 was based on SGML. The DTD specifies the rules for the markup language, so that the browsers render the content correctly.</h5>

<h4>How to mark up important ext and how is it displayed in the browser?</h4>
<h5><h1>
This tag is used for a “level 1” heading. That is, it's the most important heading on the page. Typically, every page should start with an <h1> that has the same contents as the <title>: the main title for the page.
<em>
This tag indicates emphasized text: some important word or phrase in the sentence. An <em> must go inside a paragraph (or heading, or other “block-level” element as we'll see later).
<ul>
This tag describes an unordered list. That is, it contains a list of things where the order isn't important. The <ul> element (and the ordered list version <ol>, or menu list <menu>) can't contain text the way a <p> can: it can only contain <li> elements.
<li>
These are the only thing that can go in a <ul> or <ol> element (and can only be inside one of those elements). They denote list items.</h5>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<strong>This text is strongly emphasized and most browsers would display it as bold type.</strong>

<h4>What is a web client?</h4>
<h5>The client, or user, side of the Web. It typically refers to the Web browser in the user's machine. It may also refer to plug-ins and helper applications that enhance the browser to support special services from the site</h5>

<h4>What does a web client?</h4>
<h5>A web client is an application that communicates with a web server, using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the protocol behind the World Wide Web. With every web transaction, HTTP is invoked. ... But this book is not for the average web user.</h5>

<h4>Web Client and Web Browser is the same</h4>
<h5>Web client is the sending and receiving of information where the webserver is storing the information, the web client can be a number of methods of sending and receiving the data.</h5>
